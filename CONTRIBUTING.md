# Contributing to the Awesome Crypto Art List

Welcome, it is great that you want to contribute to the list.

Please add your suggestions to the appropriate section in alphabetical order _with the exception of artist names_, which sort based on the complete name/title and _not_ by last name as established.

Once you've pushed your feature branch, please open a pull request to add or update content.

If you want to discuss something more complex than adding or editing an entry, (such as the addition of new sections or major edits) please feel free to [file an issue](https://github.com/obxium/awesome-crypto-art/issues) so that we can discuss it further.
